# Diagonal Star

This program prints a rectangural pattern and its diagonals, composed of stars (*).

## Features

The program allows the user to type at the keyboard a number with an integer value.
If the number is lesser than 5, than the message "Invalid Value" is displayed.
If the number entered by the user is greater than 5, than the program outputs a rectangle and its diagonals using asterisks symbols.

## About The Coding

The program has been written using for loops, but also, for the purpose of learning, using while loops (this variant is commented in the source file of the DiagonalStar Class).

## How To Run The Program

The repository contains a .jar file which you can freely download and test the application.
